# FastType

FastType is a web-based typing game designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy. The game presents a series of words that the user must type as quickly and accurately as possible within a set time limit. At the end of each game, the user's words per minute (WPM) score is calculated and displayed. The game also features a leaderboard to track high scores.
