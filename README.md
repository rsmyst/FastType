# Word Processing Script

## Overview
This project provides a simple JavaScript-based script to handle and process a predefined set of words. The list contains common English words, which can be used for various purposes, such as:

- Word games or puzzles
- Text processing or analysis
- Vocabulary generation
- Language learning tools

## How It Works
The script initializes a variable `words`, which stores a string of common English words. You can manipulate this variable to perform different tasks such as searching for specific words, counting word occurrences, or applying transformations.

## Usage
1. **Include the script**: Integrate the `script.js` file into your project by importing or copying the code into your JavaScript environment.
2. **Modify or Extend**: Feel free to modify the word list or extend the functionality of the script for specific word-processing needs.
